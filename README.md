# Feature Engineering

## Models and Features

> the process involves two mathematical entities that are the bread and butter of machine learning.

**Mathematical/Statistical Modeling** - describes the relationships between different aspects of data.

**Feature** - is a numeric representation of raw data.

**Feature Engineering** - the process of formulating the most appropriate features given the data, the model and the task.
