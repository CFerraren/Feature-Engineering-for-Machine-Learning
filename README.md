# Feature Engineering
---


## Models and Features

> the process involves two mathematical entities that are the bread and butter of machine learning.

**Mathematical/Statistical Modeling** - describes the relationships between different aspects of data.

**Feature** - is a numeric representation of raw data.

**Feature Engineering** - the process of formulating the most appropriate features given the data, the model and the task.

**[02_Simple Numbers](https://github.com/CFerraren/Feature-Engineering-for-Machine-Learning/tree/master/02_Simple%20Numbers) Discusses number of common numeric feature engineeringtechniques, such as quantization, scaling(normalization), log transforms(a type of power transform), and interaction features, and gave a brief summary of feature selection techniques, necessary for handling large quantities of intreaction features.**
